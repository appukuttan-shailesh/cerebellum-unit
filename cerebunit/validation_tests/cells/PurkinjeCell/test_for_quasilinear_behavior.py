    The QuasiLinear Test is a test where the model is injected with currents.
    First the model is injected with increasing currents in steps.
    This is followed by decreasing currents (same amplitudes).
    For each respective amplitude current injection the mean spiking frequencies
    are compared. The Binary score is 1 if the frequencies are different.
    The OverallBinary score is 1 if this is the case for all the amplitudes.
